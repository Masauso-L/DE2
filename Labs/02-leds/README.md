# Lab 2: Control of GPIO, LED, push butt

### Learning objectives

  * Use LEDs and push buttons
  * Config input/output ports of AVR using control registers
  * Use ATmega328P manual and find information
  * Use breadboard and connect electronic devices to AVR pins

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to learn how to use basic input/output devices such as LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) and push buttons, and how to control GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins with help of control registers.

| **LED color** | **Supply voltage** | **LED current** | **LED voltage** | **Resistor value** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| red | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 2.0 V | 150 |
| blue | 5&nbsp;V | 20&nbsp;mA | 3.2 V | 90 |
