## Lab 3: User library for GPIO control

### Learning objectives

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to learn how to create your own library in C. Specifically, it will be a library for controlling GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins.

## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

Fill in the following table and enter the number of bits and numeric range for the selected data types defined by C.

| **Data type** | **Number of bits** | **Range** | **Description** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-- | 
| `uint8_t`  | 8 | 0, 1, ..., 255 | Unsigned 8-bit integer |
| `int8_t`   | 8 | -128,-127...127 | Signed 8-bit integer |
| `uint16_t` | 16 | 0,1...65538 | Unsigned 16-bit integer  |
| `int16_t`  | 16 | -32768...32767  | Signed 16-bit integer |
| `float`    | 32 | -3.4e+38 ,..., 3.4e+38 | Single-precision floating-point |
| `void`     | * | *  | Used for pointers |
